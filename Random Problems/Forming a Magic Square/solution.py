"""Task 

We define a magic square to be an n x n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to nË†2 
where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
You will be given a 3 x 3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1,9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1,9] at cost of |a-b|. 
Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range [1,9].
